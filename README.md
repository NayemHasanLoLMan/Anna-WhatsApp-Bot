# 🧠 Anna - AI Personalized WhatsApp Bot for Airbnb Hosts

Anna is an intelligent AI agent designed to manage customer interactions on WhatsApp for Airbnb hosts. It mimics the host’s personal tone and communication style, providing fast, consistent, and contextually accurate responses to guest queries. Powered by OpenAI and integrated with Pinecone for vector-based knowledge retrieval, Anna is a smart solution for automating guest communication while retaining a personal touch.




# 🚀 Features

🤖 Personalized AI Communication:

- Fine-tuned using chat history or example messages to match the host’s tone and style.

- Replies feel human, friendly, and on-brand.




# 📱 WhatsApp Integration:

- Seamlessly connected to WhatsApp via the Twilio API or WhatsApp Business API.

- Real-time customer engagement, available 24/7.



# 🧠 Pinecone Vector Database:

- Stores custom property knowledge, FAQs, and previous guest interactions as embeddings.

- Fast semantic search for relevant responses.

- Supports real-time updates—new data can be pushed into Pinecone on the fly.



# 🏠 Airbnb Property Intelligence:

- Loaded with detailed knowledge about all listings (e.g., check-in times, amenities, house rules).

- Custom responses per listing, including dynamic references to availability, location, and instructions.




# 🔁 Continuous Learning:

- Admins can refine responses, update property knowledge, or inject new tone/stylistic samples.

- Anna evolves over time to stay relevant and more aligned with host preferences.

# ⚙️ How It Works

Training Phase

- Upload example conversations or tone samples.

- Ingest Airbnb property data (manual input or scraped).

- Generate vector embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002.

- Store embeddings in Pinecone with metadata.

Messaging Workflow

- Guest sends a message on WhatsApp.

- The webhook sends this to the bot backend.

- The query is embedded and matched against Pinecone’s knowledge base.

- Relevant context is retrieved.

- OpenAI generates a response in the host’s style using the context + query.

- Response is sent back to the guest via WhatsApp API.

- Knowledge Update

- Admin uploads new property data or Q&A through a dashboard or API.

- Data is embedded and added to Pinecone in real-time.
