## Guest Messaging Scenarios

### Can We Drop Off Luggage Early?
| Default | Paradise Ln | The M | Exception |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| Thanks for reaching out! We're unable to accommodate early luggage drop-offs due to limited storage space and the need for our cleaning team to have uninterrupted access to prepare the home for your stay. We appreciate your understanding. If you'd like, we're happy to provide recommendations for nearby places to visit while you wait. | Thank you for reaching out! We're happy to accommodate early luggage drop-offs to our garage after 11:30 am. It's crucial that no luggage is dropped off prior to this time, and we kindly request that guests only access the garage prior to time of check-in.<br/><br/>You can access the garage using the touchpad on the left side of the garage. The code is 7117 Enter (press keys slowly).<br/><br/>If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to let us know. | Thank you for reaching out! We're happy to accommodate early luggage drop-offs to our garage after 11:30 am. It's crucial that no luggage is dropped off prior to this time, and we kindly request that guests only access the garage prior to time of check-in.<br/><br/>You can access the garage using the MyQ app. What is your email address? We can add you to the app now.<br/><br/>If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to let us know. | *We can check with the cleaner to see if early luggage drop-off is possible, provided that:*<br/>1. *It doesn't disrupt the cleaning schedule.*<br/>2. *The cleaning team is present when the guest drops off luggage.*<br/>3. *There's no risk of overlap between the departing and arriving guests.*<br/>4. *The guest doesn't enter the property before it's cleaned to avoid any negative first impressions.* |

### The Schlage or Kwikset Door Code Is Not Working
**Common Issues**:
1. Guests mistakenly go to the wrong door (frequent at Arcadia, Heatherbrae 1, Heatherbrae 23).
2. Guest is trying to use the code for a nearby lockbox instead of the Smartlock (common at Heatherbrae 1 due to screen door).
3. Schlage lock loses connection, causing the shared code to not sync.
4. Schlage lock battery is depleted.
5. Guest is checking in >2 hours prior to check-in, and their unique code is not working.

**Check Lock Status**: [https://app.guesty.com/integrations/guesty-locks-manager/locks/linked](https://app.guesty.com/integrations/guesty-locks-manager/locks/linked).

| Share Backup Code | Troubleshoot | Share Lockbox Info to Access Spare Key |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| Hi [GUEST NAME], can you try code [XXXX]? Let me know if that works for you.<br/>*Follow up after guest confirms new code is working:*<br/>Great, thank you for confirming. Apologies for the inconvenience. We use Smartlocks, and a unique code is generated for each guest. However, it seems that the code didn't sync properly this time. You can continue to use the code [XXXX] for entry.<br/>**Avoid sharing cleaning code. Instead, share a backup code from “Locks Manager” in Guesty. However, if nothing else is working, you can share cleaning code as a last resort.** | Hmm. That code should be working for you. Let’s make sure you are at the right unit.<br/>**Arcadia**:<br/>Our unit is right on 38th St. You should be able to see the road from the front door. If you entered through a gate into a courtyard, then you are in the wrong place.<br/>**Heatherbrae 1**:<br/>There are 2 courtyards that look almost identical. Can you make sure you are at 7200 E Heatherbrae and not 7400 Heatherbrae?<br/>OR<br/>Can you confirm that you are using the touchpad on the door and not the lockbox? You will need to open the screen door to access the touchpad.<br/>**Heatherbrae 23**:<br/>There are 2 courtyards that look almost identical. Can you make sure you are at 7400 E Heatherbrae and not 7200 Heatherbrae? | Okay, we can try one more thing. We have a spare key available in a lockbox which you can find [see property notes for lockbox location]. Use code [XXXX] to open the lockbox. |

### The Guest Is Unable to Open the Lockbox
Hi [GUEST NAME], can you try holding the lockbox shut tightly and then enter the code? Our cleaning team just used the lockbox, so we know it worked recently. Occasionally, the lockbox can get jammed. You might also try gently shaking the lockbox to ensure the key inside isn't causing any obstruction.

### Can I Check In Early / Check Out Late?
**(When we do NOT have a guest checking in or out on the same day)**

- If unlikely to get a last-minute booking, offer up to a 2-hour complimentary early/late check-in/out.
- If the guest wants to check in/out more than 2 hours of the scheduled check time, charge an hourly rate.
- **ONLY OFFER EARLY CHECK-IN IF UNLIKELY TO GET ANOTHER BOOKING.**
- **Extended Early Check-In**: If available, offer check-in earlier than 1:00/2:00 PM for $20/hour ($40/hour for Desert Rose).
- **If a guest pays to check in early/late**:
  - Request the fee through Airbnb (for VRBO/direct booking, tag the manager).
  - Block the night before or after in the calendar to prevent another booking.
  - If checking in >6 hours early or checking out >4 hours late: Add new Schlage code.
- **VERY IMPORTANT**: Schlage Smartlocks do not generate the code until 2 hours prior to check-in. For early check-ins, share a backup code from [https://app.guesty.com/integrations/guesty-locks-manager/locks/linked](https://app.guesty.com/integrations/guesty-locks-manager/locks/linked).

**Responses**:
- **If likely to receive another booking (far out, busy season, or weekend)**:
  > If we don’t have guests checking out on the same day, we’re happy to offer a 2-hour early check-in. However, we won’t be able to confirm until the day before your stay.
- **If unlikely to receive a last-minute booking (last minute, off-season, weekday)**:
  > We’re happy to offer a complimentary [up to 2 hours before/after check-in/out] [CHECK-IN / CHECK-OUT]. If you need more time beyond that, we can usually accommodate for $20 per additional hour. Just let us know what time you’d like to [CHECK-IN / CHECK-OUT], and we’ll do our best to make it work!
- **Example for offering paid early check-in**:
  > Hi Cindy, we can’t confirm an early check-in until the day before your arrival, as we may need to accommodate a last-minute booking. However, we’re happy to offer a complimentary 2 p.m. check-in as long as there isn’t another guest checking out that morning. If you’d like to check in earlier than 2 p.m., we can often accommodate for $20 per hour beyond the complimentary two hours, depending on availability. Let us know what time you’d like to check in, and we’ll do our best to make it work!

### Responding to Request for Early Cancellation of a Long Stay
**(When making an exception to the cancellation policy)**

1. Briefly empathize with the guest if appropriate.
2. Don’t make promises. Inform the guest:
   - Cancellation policy protects the team and business; exceptions are rare.
   - Acknowledge the unpredictable nature of the situation.
3. If the guest hasn’t initiated the change/cancellation, ask them to do so.
4. If another booking is secured, flexibility with reimbursement is possible.

**Example Email to Guest**:
> [Judy called me yesterday to let me know they won't be able to return to the cabin. We're so sorry to hear that. Are you able to change the end date on your end?] I've started a conversation with the owner about the possibility of providing reimbursement for the unused nights. This is always a tight spot for us, but we understand the unpredictable nature of these situations and want to be understanding.<br/>The first step is to adjust the calendar so we can reopen these nights for booking. If we're able to get another booking, then we can be more flexible with the reimbursement.

**Follow-Up if Refund Cannot Be Approved**:
> I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on your refund request. Unfortunately, the owner cannot approve the refund, and there's little we can do to change this decision.<br/>We understand how disappointing this must be, especially given the circumstances. In an effort to support you, the owner is offering a transferable $850 credit that can be used for a stay at the cabin anytime within the next 12 months by you or a family member or friend.<br/>We genuinely empathize with your situation, but our cancellation policies are essential for maintaining our operations. We hope this credit provides some flexibility and helps you plan a future visit.<br/>Thank you for your understanding. Please let us know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

**To Owner (via Email or Text/WhatsApp)**:
> [Context: Our long stay guest at the cabin has been enjoying a wonderful time. Then the guest Judy messaged me to say her husband, Don, has Pneumonia and is in the hospital and they won't be able to return to the cabin. They're an 83-year-old couple who was staying to spend time with their daughter.]<br/>Our policy is no refunds 30 days after check-in, so we are not responsible for reimbursing any amount.<br/>Also, we will be able to unblock the calendar and earn income for unused nights.<br/>Judy called me yesterday and mentioned that any amount would help.<br/>She acknowledged our cancellation policy and expressed gratitude for any assistance.<br/>**Would you feel comfortable reimbursing 20% or 25% of the unused nights? That would be a $832 or $1040 reimbursement.**<br/>I feel confident we can get $2000 in bookings over that time anyway, so we'll actually come out ahead. I also already backed out the cleaning fee and fees. Math is below.<br/>**$8185 Total stay amount**<br/>- $319 transaction fees<br/>- $150 cleaning fee<br/>= $7716<br/>/48 nights booked<br/>= $160 x 26 unused nights<br/>= $4160 x 25%<br/>= $1040<br/>I'm open to another arrangement if this doesn't feel good for you.<br/>Thank you! Brindy

### Are Pets Allowed?
- If a pet is included in the reservation at a pet-friendly property, the pet fee is automatically requested and charged.
- Confirm pet inclusion in Guesty.
- Pet fee covers up to 2 dogs (3rd dog considered case-by-case with additional fee).
- For properties allowing dogs case-by-case: Consider guest reviews and Airbnb account age.
- Refer to Property Spreadsheet for pet fees and policies: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vYBsQHgBkKXs2kDteu7Pim5__zXCWQ7ANzdMovoi6kE/edit#gid=1239572775](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vYBsQHgBkKXs2kDteu7Pim5__zXCWQ7ANzdMovoi6kE/edit#gid=1239572775).

**Are Cats Allowed?**
- Only dog-friendly listings can be considered for cats.
- Ask: “Have you traveled with your cat before? We typically do not accept cats but are willing to discuss with the owner to see if we can make an exception.”
- If the response raises red flags:
  > We spoke with the owner and are not able to accept cats in our home at this time. Best of luck finding something that will work for you!
- If no red flags:
  > We are happy to accommodate your cat as long as the following conditions are met. We require guests to provide a litter box as well as a cat tree or similar item to prevent any scratching on furniture. Are you able to provide these items? We also require that cats are neutered or spayed. Can you confirm if your cat has been spayed/neutered? Lastly, we do require a non-refundable pet fee of ($00.00). Is this agreeable? If so, we can request the additional fee and we’re all set.

**Pet Hair from Guest but Didn’t Pay**:
> We hope you made it home and are settled in! Our cleaning team let us know that they found quite a bit of pet hair and charged us extra for cleaning. We do charge a $90 pet fee per our Airbnb listing and house rules. I went ahead and charged this through Airbnb.<br/>(Attach pictures)
- How to add a pet fee on VRBO: [https://help.guesty.com/hc/en-gb/articles/9360495210013-Adding-an-additional-fee-to-a-reservation-manually](https://help.guesty.com/hc/en-gb/articles/9360495210013-Adding-an-additional-fee-to-a-reservation-manually).

**Other Pet-Related Fees**:
- $75 charge for pet waste left behind.
- $200/$300 fee if guest brings pets without prior approval.
- Cat fee is 2x dog fee.

**Service Dogs (Non-Pet-Friendly Home)**:
> We do have a strict no-pet policy. This is because the owner does not allow pets in the home. However, we do not consider service animals to be pets.<br/>We do not need any paperwork; however, we are required to ask what work or task the service animal has been trained to perform?<br/>As long as it is a trained service animal who will not be left unattended or allowed on the furniture, and as long as you agree that you will be responsible to pay an additional cleaning fee for any pet hair or mess left behind, we’re happy to host you.

### Maintenance Issue
- Ask clarifying questions to understand the scope.
- For thermostat or AC/heat issues, request a photo of the thermostat.
- Always request photos where possible.
- Ask:
  - Was it like this when you arrived?
  - When did you first notice this?
- Determine if urgent or if it can wait until after checkout.
- If non-urgent and repairable during stay, ask:
  > Would you prefer us to send someone to fix this during your stay or wait till after you check out?
- Avoid over-promising:
  > I’m going to see how quickly we can have someone out. I will let you know as soon as I confirm.
- For urgent issues, update the guest every few hours:
  > We’re still waiting for our handyman to confirm his schedule. I should know shortly. Thank you so much for your patience.

### Red Flags to Watch Out For / Responding to Weird Inquiries
- **RED FLAG #1**: Airbnb account <1 year old.
- **RED FLAG #2**: Identity not verified.
- For guests with both red flags:
  > We require guests to have their identity verified through Airbnb and can only accept stays from guests who have a good track record with Airbnb.
- For strange requests, respond firmly and coldly but quickly for algorithm purposes.
- If too many red flags, immediately click “Decline”.
- If the guest agrees to verify identity and sends sensible messages, consider it may be their first Airbnb experience.

### How to Pay a Requested Fee
> You should have an email from Airbnb. This link should also take you there: [https://www.airbnb.com/resolutions](https://www.airbnb.com/resolutions).

### Questions About Airbnb Payments
> As hosts, we don’t handle any of the payment processing for Airbnb bookings. This is always handled through Airbnb. If guests have questions about changing their credit card, or when their card will be charged, you can let them know: “As hosts, we don’t have visibility into payment details. I recommend reaching out to Airbnb Support at 1 (844) 234-2500, and they can help clear this up for you.”

### Airbnb Won’t Accept Reservation
> Hi (name)! Sorry you’re having trouble booking. A couple options—<br/>First, you can try to have someone else in your party book on Airbnb. The reason that the booking is being flagged is likely because your location (Tucson) is within close proximity of our home. It’s a frustrating thing about Airbnb’s system for flagging potential parties, but from experience, I know it’s something they won’t budge on.<br/>The second option is you can book with us another way. The tricky thing is that we can’t share this info through Airbnb.<br/>You can try to look it up—it is called SouthwestWanderlust.

### Wi-Fi Isn’t Working
- Can you try unplugging the Wi-Fi router for 10 seconds, then plugging back in? It’s the [white box beneath the TV].
- Also, is the router blinking any lights? Are there any lights on?
- Can you try using Wi-Fi on another device or try streaming something on the TV?
- **Actions**:
  1. Log into Cox account to check for outages.
  2. Wait 2 hours.
  3. Call provider for a possible reset.
  4. Decide if an in-person visit is necessary.

### Identity Verification
> We’d love to host you. We do require that guests have their identity verified through Airbnb. You can do this by typing /verify at the end of Airbnb’s web address. Once verified, we can pre-approve your stay.

### Request to Waive Cleaning Fee
> Our cleaning fee is a pass-through fee that goes directly to pay our team. Our cost is the same regardless of length of stay, so we don't have any flexibility. We'd love to host you! I'll go ahead and pre-approve your stay in case this works for you.

### Guest Asks for Address Prior to Booking
- Do not share the specific address. Provide nearby intersection roads if they have location questions.

### Request for Discount
- Consider a 10% discount if:
  - Request is <30 days out.
  - Stay is 4+ days.
  - Guest has 2+ great reviews or is likely to be a great guest.
  - **Watch for red flags** of neediness.
- If discount unavailable:
  > Thank you for your inquiry! We’d love to host you. We do not have any discounts available at this time. I’ll go ahead and pre-approve your stay in case this works for you!
- If discount available:
  - Apply 10% off nightly rate only (not cleaning fees).
  - Send a special offer through Airbnb: [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/35#section-heading-1-0](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/35#section-heading-1-0).
  - Add cleaning fee to the nightly rate manually.
  - Message:
    > Thank you for your interest in our home. We don’t typically offer discounts, but given your excellent track record, we're happy to provide a 10% discount for your stay. We’ll send a special offer now.

### Roku TV Remote Lost or Not Working
> Thank you for letting us know, there is an app to access the TV. Make sure you are on the Wi-Fi, and this is the link. We will be sure to order a new remote asap: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-roku-app-official/id482066631](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-roku-app-official/id482066631).
- If extra batteries are available, direct the guest to their location.

### Can I See the Apartment/House Before Booking?
- For stays <30 nights: Always no, no exceptions.
- For stays >30 nights, consider if:
  - Guest has verified identity and excellent track record (2+ reviews, established Airbnb account).
  - Note: Risky, logistically difficult, and time-consuming, so only for high-value, long-term bookings.

### Can I Venmo You? / Can I Book Directly?
- Standard response:
  > We can only accept bookings through Airbnb. We’d love to host you if this works for you.
- For trusted guests:
  > We are limited in what we can share here. How can we find you?
  > OR
  > We are limited in what we can share here. You can find us at Southwest Wanderlust.
- Direct booking site: [www.southwestwanderlust.com](http://www.southwestwanderlust.com).
- Note: Avoid sharing website/email addresses in Airbnb messages to prevent account flagging.

### Double Booking / Host Cancellation
> Hello, This booking was canceled due to a system error that created a duplicate listing for our home with inaccurate rates and availability. We’re unable to accept bookings through this account and are working with Airbnb’s security team now to resolve this issue. Your reservation has been cancelled, and you will receive a full refund. If you’re interested in re-booking, you can do so here as long as your dates are available:

### Superhog False Request to Airbnb Guest
> Thank you for checking on this. Yes, this is legitimate; however, no action is required. This is only required for stays outside of Airbnb and should not have been sent. I can go ahead and delete the request from my end. No further action is required, and we look forward to hosting you!

### How to Handle Last-Minute Stays
- Identity verification required, no exceptions.
- First response:
  > Thank you for your inquiry! Let us double-check with our cleaning team that we can be ready in time. What time are you looking to check in?
  > Once we accept your stay, your card will be charged, and the stay will be confirmed. Can you confirm that you would like to move forward? We do require a quick phone call for last-minute guests before we share the door code. Can you agree to give us a quick call once the stay is confirmed?
- Phone call required unless the guest has 2+ positive reviews and no red flags.
- On the phone:
  > We always like to speak with last-minute guests. Is it okay if I ask a couple quick questions to make sure we’re all set?
  - What brings you to …?
  - We do not allow more than [x] people in the home at any given time. Do you plan on having anyone over?
  - Do you know what time you will be checking in? And what time do you think you’ll be checking out?
  - We only have parking for [x] number of cars. Will this work for you?
- If security concern:
  - Block auto-message in Guesty to prevent sharing check-in code.
  - Replace guest code in Guesty: [https://app.guesty.com/integrations/guesty-locks-manager/locks/linked](https://app.guesty.com/integrations/guesty-locks-manager/locks/linked).

### Request Compensation for Damage
> Hi Tianna,<br/>Our cleaning team noticed that a new mattress topper was left badly stained, along with a couple of towels that had been used to clean up a brown liquid. We understand that this may have been an accident or an effort to clean up, and we appreciate the other efforts you made to maintain the space.<br/>While we won't charge for the additional cleaning needed, we do need to request compensation for the stained towels and mattress cover. Thank you for your understanding.<br/>Best regards,

### Guests Who Require Special Handling
- **VIP**:
  - First 3 guests of a new listing.
  - Return guests.
  - Guests staying >30 nights.
- **Last-Minute Guests**.
- **Escalated**:
  - Guest indicates unhappiness.
- **Bad Guest**:
  - Guest caused damage to the home.

### Request to Guest to Leave a Review
*Note: Auto-messages already request a 5-star review. For early guests at new listings, if no review is left by the 3rd day after checkout and the stay was smooth, send:*
> Hi [Guest's Name], We hope you made it back home and are settled in. We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your stay! If you're able, it would mean a lot to us if you could leave us a review. This is a new listing, and reviews help us a bunch. We already left you a five-star review and thank you for taking such good care of our home. Of course, if you do have any feedback, please feel welcome sharing that through messaging here. This helps us grow as hosts.

### Handwritten Notes
**For First 3 Guests**:
> Welcome to [City or House Name]! We’re so thrilled to have you as one of our first guests. Your feedback means the world to us as we work to make this home as cozy and comfortable as possible. Our goal is to provide a truly 5-star stay, so if there’s anything we can improve or assist with, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us directly through Airbnb. Thank you for staying with us—we hope you feel right at home and have a wonderful visit!
> OR
> We’re delighted to welcome you as one of our first guests! Your feedback is so important to us as we work to make our home as cozy and comfortable as possible. Our goal is to provide a 5-star stay, so if there’s anything we can improve or assist with, please feel free to message us directly through Airbnb.<br/>Thank you for choosing to stay with us. We hope you have a wonderful visit!<br/>- Host name (ie: Brindy & Michelle)

### Escalations
**If a Cleaning Was Missed**:
> Hey Shannon, it looks like our team finished up cleaning for you. Do you now have everything you need?<br/>Once again, I am so sorry about this. We hold ourselves to a higher standard, and we really regret that you had to experience the inconvenience that this caused.<br/>We’ve already taken action to ensure it does not happen again. I will send reimbursement now for last night plus the cleaning fee. You should get an email from Airbnb confirming once this goes through.<br/>Truly, thank you for your kindness and flexibility. I know how frustrated I would have been, and we appreciate your understanding. If there’s any more we can do to help make up for it, please let us know.

**To Prevent a Bad Review (Use Carefully)**:
> Hi Giselle, I wanted to thank you again for your incredible kindness and understanding about the cleaning issue upon arrival.<br/>Since this stay doesn't deserve a 5-star review, if you'd consider not leaving a review at all, we'd greatly appreciate it.<br/>We immediately focused on creating a foolproof process to ensure this never happens again—we want to learn from this.<br/>Thank you for allowing us to make it right by reimbursing the first night. We will, of course, leave you a glowing review and would be grateful if there isn't a review that reflects this aspect of your experience as our goal is that this never ever happens again 😅<br/>Thank you again, and if you're back in Tempe, let us know! We’d love to welcome you back with a 10% discount 😊

**For a 3-Star or Lower Review (Part 1)**:
> Hi Hayley, I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to thank you for your kind words in the public review and for choosing to stay with us. It’s wonderful to hear that you enjoyed your time at the house.<br/>I also noticed your private feedback about the floors and truly appreciate you bringing that to our attention. We didn’t hear from you during your stay, so I wanted to mention that we’re always available to address any concerns in real-time to ensure everything is perfect while you're with us.<br/>I saw that you left a 3-star rating. Since we always strive to offer a 5-star experience for all our guests, I wanted to ask if there’s anything specific we could do better to make the home even more enjoyable.<br/>Airbnb’s rating system can be a bit tricky, as they consider anything less than 5 stars as indicating that the home might not be recommended.<br/>Our top priority is ensuring that our guests have a wonderful experience and truly enjoy their stay. We also want our reviews to reflect the effort we put into making each visit special. With the upcoming Superhost review, it’s important for us to maintain these high standards.<br/>Airbnb doesn’t allow editing reviews after they’re published, but you can request removal if you’re comfortable with it.<br/>If that’s something you’d be open to, here’s the link to request it: [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/3582#section-heading-2-0](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/3582#section-heading-2-0).<br/>For easy reference, your confirmation code is: HMD9ARYYFC.<br/>Of course, there’s no pressure, and I completely understand if you’d prefer not to. We’re just grateful for your feedback and for choosing to stay with us.

**For a 3-Star or Lower Review (Part 2)**:
> Hi XXXX,<br/>I'm reaching out to see if there's anything you think we could do to improve our home, such that it would earn a 5-star review. Airbnb considers anything under 5 stars unsatisfactory, so although 4 sounds good (and on most scales, it is), we are truly striving for the 4.8 minimum Superhost requirement, especially since the next Superhost assessment is coming up. Considering your review sounds like you had a great experience, I am hoping to get some insight as to how we could meet (and hopefully exceed) what it would take to earn 5 stars in the future.<br/>I truly appreciate any feedback you can provide, thank you so much.<br/>**After they respond**:<br/>Unfortunately, there isn't a way to edit a published review, but it can be removed if requested by the author. In case you'd be open to it, you can request it here: [https://www.airbnb.com/help/contact-us/channel](https://www.airbnb.com/help/contact-us/channel).<br/>Your confirmation code was: XXXXXXXXX.<br/>I understand if not, but if you did enjoy your stay, I would really appreciate the help.
